  Diseases in crops mostly on the leaves affects on the reduction of both quality and quantity of agricultural products. Perception of human eye is not so much stronger so as to observe minute variation in the infected part of leaf. In this project, we are providing software solution(Andriod & Web Application) to automatically detect and classify plant leaf diseases. In this we are using image processing techniques to classify diseases & quickly diagnosis can be carried out as per disease. This approach will enhance productivity of crops. It includes several steps viz. image acquisition, image pre- processing, segmentation, features extraction and neural network based classification</p>
